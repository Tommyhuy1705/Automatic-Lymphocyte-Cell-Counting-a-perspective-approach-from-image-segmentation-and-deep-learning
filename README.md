# Automatic-Lymphocyte-Cell-Counting-a-perspective-approach-from-image-segmentation-and-deep-learning

## Introduction  
Accurate lymphocyte cell counting plays a critical role in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics, providing essential insights into immune system health and disease progression. Traditionally, this task has been performed manually by experts under microscopes, which is both time-consuming and prone to human error. To address these challenges, automated computer vision techniques have emerged as promising solutions for reliable and scalable cell analysis.

In this project, we benchmark two popular deep learning approaches for lymphocyte cell counting:

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** — state-of-the-art object detection model for fast and precise localization.  
- **U-Net** — convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation, effective at capturing pixel-level structures.  

We evaluate both models on an augmented dataset of lymphocyte cell images, focusing on accuracy, error metrics, and robustness.

## **Features**
- Automated lymphocyte cell counting for biomedical image analysis.
- Cell localization and detection using **YOLOv8**.
- Pixel-level segmentation using **U-Net**.
- Comparison of two approaches:
  - Detection-based (bounding box predictions with YOLO).
  - Segmentation-based (binary masks with U-Net).
- Evaluation with regression and error metrics:
  - **RMSE**, **MAE**, **MAPE**, **R²**, **Dispersion Statistics**.
- Data augmentation pipeline (rotation, flipping, shifting, scaling, brightness adjustment, Gaussian noise).
- Benchmarking on augmented lymphocyte dataset with consistent training/testing splits.
